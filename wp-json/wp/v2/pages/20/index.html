My name is David Preece-Phillips.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve worked in the communications, content, digital, media and technology sectors for nearly 20 years. I&#8217;m experienced in content strategy, content design, innovation, product design, working with data, communications and marketing, user experience and usability, customer experience, and agile project management.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have experience working on a wide range of projects including content strategies, user experience research and design, digital transformation, new digital product development, prototyping new technology and global marcomms campaigns. Mostly, I work with organisations to pick apart interesting design challenges, create innovative new products and ways of communicating, and help them to achieve their goals and ambitions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess you could say I&#8217;m in the middle of a Venn diagram of digital strategist, user experience designer, and content strategist. A content experience strategist? A digital content designer? A user experience strategist? \ud83e\udd14<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever you want to call it, I enjoy it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My career journey so far has involved freelance journalism, publishing companies, digital media start-ups, national utility companies and international consultancies. Along the way, I&#8217;ve worked with some of the biggest, most innovative brands in the world and some truly brilliant people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m currently Strategy Director at SHIFT Active Media, a <a href=\"http:\/\/shiftactivemedia.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">marketing consultancy dedicated to cycling<\/a>. I really like bikes and cycling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some kind words from people I\u2019ve worked with in the past:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;I\u2019ve known and worked with David across two different companies in the past five years. In both of those positions, David was leading the strategy function. Whilst different businesses, his approach was the same \u2013 clear and sensible implementation of plans based on data that puts customers first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think this sums him up well, he\u2019s able to very quickly get to the core of something, the nub of what\u2019s really important, and put it in terms and plans that everyone can understand and follow. That\u2019s invaluable in a business setting and the key to good strategy; that\u2019s what makes David such a good person to work with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can take anything to him and because of his understanding and interest in everything digital, he\u2019ll likely be able to help you, and if he can\u2019t, he\u2019ll go out of his way to research and find out so that he can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve learned a lot from him in the times we\u2019ve worked together and I hope to work with David again in the future.&#8221;<\/p>\n<cite>\u2013\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/chrisrandalluk\/\">Chris Randall<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I\u2019ve known and worked with David for years and I\u2019m struggling to think of another individual who just *gets* the fundamentals of digital so much. I mean from a product and user perspective, how things work and why someone might give a crap about using things. You might peg this as UX, but it\u2019s something broader then that \u2013 the essence of a service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019d work with David again in a heartbeat. Like, I really hope I do. (He\u2019s also not a wonk. He\u2019s a thoroughly nice guy, funny, sane, practical, and not ego-driven\u2026 and that\u2019s gold in this business!)&#8221;<\/p>\n<cite>\u2013\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/rogerwarner\/\">Roger Warner<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What can I say about Dave? I worked with him for four years, and from the first day I met him I knew he was pretty darn great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is warm, funny, kind and a fantastic manager. He really cared about his team and their development and was a really valuable support to me as I grew into my people and culture role at Brilliant Noise. I really valued his advice and ideas, and his strategic mindset and experience added depth to my thinking. He cares deeply about where he works and is always committed to building the culture and welcoming people into it. He can also make me laugh until I cry a little bit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He\u2019s only just moved on but I miss him already, and I hope that one day we\u2019ll get to work together again!&#8221;<\/p>\n<cite>\u2013\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/amdipper\/\">Alice Mateos-Dipper<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;David is a brilliant strategic thinker and leader. I\u2019ve worked with him for 2yrs across various projects and he constantly strives for better questioning, better thinking and better outcomes for the team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>His ability to distil complex problems into understandable methods coupled with a commercial lens is a standout skill and one that both clients and teams benefit from on a daily basis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>David is a GREAT leader and influencer. His approach to team dynamics and often complex stakeholder scenarios is excellent. I\u2019ve watched him coach, mentor and lead all types of specialists at all types of levels. His ability to communicate across disciplines, hierarchies and even political settings makes him the kind of thinker you would fight to have on your team.&#8221;<\/p>\n<cite>\u2013\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/sarahracheljones\/\">Sarah Rachael Jones<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;David is a skilled and knowledgeable digital strategist, having both a broad and deep understanding of the digital industry. His work is both effective and efficient; demonstrating the ability to take a challenge and quickly identify the key issues, questions or solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I particularly valued his desire to collaborate with others on projects, to ensure the highest-quality work is delivered to the client. As our industry evolves, strategists like David will become ever more in demand. Highly recommended!&#8221;<\/p>\n<cite>\u2013\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/profile\/view?id=AAEAAACx0SsBJOGVAMBBwuwRHe2TnSLM7DwFdsA&amp;trk=miniprofile-name-link\">Patrick Sansom<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;David is one of the most efficient, diligent and capable people I have ever worked with.
